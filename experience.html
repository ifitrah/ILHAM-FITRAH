On 2018, when I was 18 years old back then, I just bought my own phone which is iPhone 6 Plus. I worked for my aunt
<br>and save money to buy the phone. I am shocked because that is my first time having a phone. So, I started to explore 
<br>the phone all by myself and get to know one gaming app which is PUBG Mobile. At first, I felt like I would not manage to
<br>play the game as it is a shooting game that would consider to have skills to play. But, as I played everyday and
<br>practicing day by day. In 4 years, which is now in 2022. I managed to play like easily, but not that I can play like
<br>a professional gamer. PUBG Mobile is like a stress ball to me, as I play it when I got stress with my assignments and studies.
<br>People always asked me "How can you not get bored by just playing that game?", I said to them "Each person have their own
<br>interest. Some of them love to practice makeup or even styling hair just to overcome their stress, and so do I!
<br>I love playing games!".

I have invested too much money just by playing games, as I usually bought some of the 'cool' outfits or skins
<br>in PUBG Mobile. It is like an addictive habits for gamers to buy lots of stuff from there. So, it is very difficult
<br>for us to leave the game easily. Besides, through mobile games, I get to know sorts of people from many countries
<br>such as India, China, Bangladesh and many more. They are all friendly, but at the same time they can be very toxic to others.
<br>I have experienced many things by playing PUBG Mobile, some are sweet and some are bitter. I guess that is life all about then.
