<br>
I am a diploma student of Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Rembau. I started my university
<br>journey on 2018, and most probably will end diploma on 2022 which is this year. The first semester of diploma was very fun
<br> because I get to spend time with my classmates and close friends around the college. The memories that we had were very special
<br>and hard to forget. Then, pandemic started when we were in second semester, that is where all of the nightmares of not 
<br>meeting them. It is very sad as I can only met them for a while. During pandemic, we spend our times studying at home and
<br>quarantine ourself for our own safety. Despite of that, I really hope that we can have our graduation day physically,
<br>so that we can meet each other again and spend our time for the last time before moving forward to our own life.
<br>
<br>Besides that, I would love to share my results starting from semester 2 until semester 4 as a memories in my diploma life.
<br>Also, I am gladly wanted to share my MUET results for the continuation of my degree.
